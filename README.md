# Fake-News-Detection ‚úÖ‚ùåüîç
* To classify news from dataset as being real or fake
* To apply and deploy baseline models, sequential models and deep learning models like LSTM to achieve a high 
accuracy.

## Data
The project's data consist of two .csv files
* [Fake.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=Fake.csv)
* [True.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=True.csv)

Each data set consisting of approximately 20k articles.

Description of columns in the file:
* title ‚Äì signifies news headlines
* text- signifies news content/article
* subject- signifies type of news
* date- signifies date the news was published

## Description
* Data Exploration
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualisation
* Natural Language Processing
* Regular Expressions
* N-Gram Analysis
* ML algorithms

## Models Implemented
* Logistic Regression
* Long Term Short Memory Model (LSTM)
* Recurrent Neural Network Model (RNN)

## Additional
* Visualkeras
```python
# if import visualkeras throws an error execute this statement, found it on the net
!pip install git+https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras --upgrade

import visualkeras
visualkeras.layered_view(model)
# model is a variable

# for example - 
model = Sequential()
```

Gives an infographic as output which looks like -

This couldnt be implemented to the architecture which I made due to some errors.

But this is an additional thing which makes your project stand out from others.

It will definitely get you some brownie points if you are making deep learning project in academic courses of uni :)
